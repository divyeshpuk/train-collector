# Train Collector
<p>My interest in the history, design and technology of railways and locomotives, and a visit to a small shop of railway models in Harlech, North Wales led me to discover the wonderful world of model railways. This website promotes Train Collector magazine by highlighting the content and articles of the current issue and the past issues.</p>
